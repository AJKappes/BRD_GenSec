### Asymmetric Information Regarding Calf Health between Feedlots and Cow-Calf Producers

This project evaluates feedlot production cost effects stemming from cow-calf producers holding private information about calf health, characterizing an asymmetric information environment. Theoretical construct is built from the wide work on contract theory. Tractable model outcomes are provided and then used for numerical analysis by specifying functional forms and assumed parameter values. Feedlot data is then used to test model outcome validity. 

Calf health is proxied by bovine respiratory disease (BRD). Genetic markers for reduced BRD susceptibility exist and can be selected when producing calves. *Marker selected* and *non-marker selected* characterize calf health type, where calves produced using marker selection technology are considered healthy with calves produced not using this technology being considered unhealthy. There exists an optimal fee schedule that the feedlot offers the cow-calf producer, who has incentive to select the fee that corresponds to their calf type, thus revealing the private information held by the cow-calf producer regarding calf health.
